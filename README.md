# Understanding GitVersion Mainline
This repo was created to understand better how the GitVersion Mainline configuration worked. I created this, because I was having trouble with version incrementing for certain actions in a project. This repo attempts to reproduce the behavior outlined in the GitVersion Mainline Configuration [documentation](https://gitversion.net/docs/reference/modes/mainline). Bottom line, I was unable to reproduce the behavior outlined in the documentation. I created a GitVersion [discussion thread](https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion/discussions/2901) to look for feedgback.

If you have comments or suggestions, please respond via the GitVersion discussion thread.

Thanks!
